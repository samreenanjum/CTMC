[[Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w57/Anjum_CTMC_Cell_Tracking_With_Mitosis_Detection_Dataset_Challenge_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf)] [[Website](https://ivc.ischool.utexas.edu/ctmc/)]

[Samreen Anjum](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~samreen/) and [Danna Gurari](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~dannag/AboutMe.html)

Presented at the [Computer Vision for Microscopy Images (CVMI)](https://cvmi2020.github.io/accepted.html) workshop, [CVPR 2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the evaluation metric, TRA, inspired from the [Cell Tracking Challenge](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/measures) and modified to support evaluation of tracking multiple objects with bounding boxes in videos.

## Challenge

We will hosting a challenge at the Computer Vision for Microscopy Images (CVMI) workshop at CVPR 2021. Details coming soon.
