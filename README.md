[Samreen Anjum](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~samreen/) and [Danna Gurari](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~dannag/AboutMe.html)

Presented at the Computer Vision for Microscopy Images (CVMI) workshop, CVPR 2020

This repository contains a Python implementation of the evaluation metric - TRA, inspired from the [Cell Tracking Challenge](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/measures) and modified to support evaluation of tracking multiple objects with bounding boxes.

## Challenge

We will hosting a challenge at the Computer Vision for Microscopy Images (CVMI) workshop at CVPR 2021. Details coming soon.
